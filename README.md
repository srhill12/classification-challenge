Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a spam detection system using two machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. The dataset used is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Library, and it contains various features extracted from email texts.

Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas library
scikit-learn library
matplotlib library (for any potential visualizations)

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic yet effective approach to spam detection using machine learning. The Random Forest Classifier outperformed the Logistic Regression model in this case, likely due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships in the data.
